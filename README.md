Arrow kit for Amazon AVS with Conexant2Mic and NXP PICO-PI-IMX7
==================================================================
## About this project

This project provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the 2 microphone development kit for Amazon AVS from Arrow. This kit consists of a Conexant AudioSmart™ 2-Mic Development Kit for Amazon AVS and a PICO-PI-IMX7 development board for the NXP i.MX 7D processor. It demonstrates how to access and test Amazon AVS, Amazon's Java sample app (running on the PICO-PI-IMX7), a Node.js server for authorization (running on the PICO-PI-IMX7), and a third-party wake word engine that responds to "Alexa" (running the low-power Sensory wake word engine or the high-performance Sensory wake word engine).
When finished, you'll have a fully functioning Amazon AVS prototype that uses the Conexant AudioSmart™ 2-Mic Development Kit as an audio front end, and the PICO-PI-IMX7 i.MX 7D development board as the processor handling the “Alexa” wake word recognition and interface to Amazon’s AVS service. The processor system is also available as the PICO-IMX7 module, a production intent System on Module (SoM) for use in consumer products.
